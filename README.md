# iKhokha Fork of octet-buffer Library

This is the official iKhokha-maintained fork of the [octet-buffer library](https://github.com/eumes/octet-buffer), originally developed by [eumes](https://github.com/eumes). The library is a lightweight wrapper around Node's native Buffer implementation, providing continuous read and write operations for various primitive types (uint8 to uint32).

- Updated to use Node.js version 18 and compatible testing libraries (Mocha, Chai).

- Future changes specific to iKhokha will follow semantic versioning conventions.
